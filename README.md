# Fog-Computing-it-s-Security-issues
This repository contains a comprehensive survey paper titled "Fog Computing and its Security Issues", authored in 2016. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the rise of fog computing as a response to the limitations of traditional cloud computing in handling real-time, latency-sensitive, and location-aware applications driven by the growth of IoT.
üìö Overview
With the explosive growth of IoT devices and the demand for near real-time data processing, traditional cloud models struggle due to latency and bandwidth issues. Fog computing brings computation closer to the data source‚Äîat the edge of the network‚Äîproviding a more scalable, responsive, and efficient alternative.
This survey paper reviews:
‚Ä¢	The architecture and core principles of Fog Computing
‚Ä¢	Key characteristics including decentralization, low latency, and proximity to devices
‚Ä¢	Applications across domains like smart grids, healthcare, Industrial IoT, and agriculture
‚Ä¢	A detailed analysis of security challenges unique to fog computing
‚Ä¢	Existing and proposed security solutions including encryption, intrusion detection, and secure protocols
üîê Key Security Issues Explored
‚Ä¢	Device vulnerabilities and physical attacks
‚Ä¢	Data privacy and integrity across distributed nodes
‚Ä¢	Distributed attack surfaces (e.g. DDoS, MITM, Sybil attacks)
‚Ä¢	Intermittent connectivity and resource constraints
‚Ä¢	Access control and authorization concerns
üõ°Ô∏è Security Mechanisms Covered
‚Ä¢	Authentication and access control (PKI, RBAC, MFA)
‚Ä¢	Data encryption (AES, RSA)
‚Ä¢	Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDPS)
‚Ä¢	Blockchain and decentralized integrity mechanisms
‚Ä¢	Secure communication (TLS, VPN, IPSec)
üîÆ Future Directions
The paper concludes with future research paths such as:
‚Ä¢	Integration of AI/ML for adaptive security
‚Ä¢	Standardized federated models for trust and communication
‚Ä¢	Optimizing fog-cloud collaboration for better performance and privacy
üìÖ Year of Research: 2016
