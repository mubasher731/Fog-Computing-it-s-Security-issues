# Fog-Computing-it-s-Security-issues

This repository contains a survey paper from 2016 that explores the concept of Fog Computing and its associated security issues. As traditional cloud computing struggled with challenges like high latency and limited bandwidth—especially in real-time IoT applications—fog computing emerged as a promising alternative by bringing computation closer to the data source. This paper provides an overview of fog computing architecture, its key characteristics, and real-world applications in areas such as smart grids, healthcare, and industrial IoT. It also highlights the major security threats faced in fog environments, including device vulnerabilities, data privacy concerns, and the expanded attack surface due to decentralization. Finally, the paper reviews existing security mechanisms and suggests directions for future research to enhance fog computing’s resilience and reliability in real-time systems.
